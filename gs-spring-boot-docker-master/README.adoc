This guide walks you through the process of building a https://docker.com[Docker] image for running a Spring Boot application.

== What you'll build

https://docker.com[Docker] is a Linux container management toolkit with a "social" aspect, allowing users to publish container images and consume those published by others. A Docker image is a recipe for running a containerized process, and in this guide we will build one for a simple Spring boot application.

NOTE: There is also a https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker[Topical Guide on Docker], which covers a wider range of choices that we have here, and in much more detail.

== What you'll need
:java_version: 1.8
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools.adoc[]

If you are NOT using a Linux machine, you will need a virtualized server. By installing VirtualBox, other tools like the Mac's boot2docker, can seamlessly manage it for you. Visit https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox's download site] and pick the version for your machine. Download and install. Don't worry about actually running it.

You will also need https://docker.com[Docker], which only runs on 64-bit machines. See https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation for details on setting Docker up for your machine. Before proceeding further, verify you can run `docker` commands from the shell. If you are using boot2docker you need to run that *first*.

== Set up a Spring Boot app

Now you can create a simple application.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

The class is flagged as a `@SpringBootApplication` and as a `@RestController`, meaning it's ready for use by Spring MVC to handle web requests. `@RequestMapping` maps `/` to the `home()` method which just sends a 'Hello World' response.  The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application.

Now we can run the application without the Docker container (i.e. in the host OS).

If you are using Gradle, execute:

[subs="attributes"]
----
./gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/{project_id}-0.1.0.jar
----

If you are using Maven, execute:

[subs="attributes"]
----
./mvnw package && java -jar target/{project_id}-0.1.0.jar
----

and go to http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080] to see your "Hello Docker World" message.

== Containerize It

Docker has a simple https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/["Dockerfile"] file format that it uses to specify the "layers" of an image. So let's go ahead and create a Dockerfile in our Spring Boot project:

`Dockerfile`
[source]
----
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/app.jar"]
----

You can run it (if you are using Maven) with

```
$ docker build -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker .
```

or (if you are using Gradle):

```
$ docker build --build-args JAR_FILE=build/libs/*.jar -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker .
```

This command builds an image and tags it as `springio/gs-spring-boot-docker`.

This Dockerfile is very simple, but that's all you need to run a Spring Boot app with no frills: just Java and a JAR file. The project JAR file is `ADDed` to the container as "app.jar" and then executed in the `ENTRYPOINT`. The array form of the Dockerfile `ENTRYPOINT` is used so that there is no shell wrapping the java process. The https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker[Topical Guide on Docker] goes into this topic in more detail.

NOTE: We added a `VOLUME` pointing to "/tmp" because that is where a Spring Boot application creates working directories for Tomcat by default. The effect is to create a temporary file on your host under "/var/lib/docker" and link it to the container under "/tmp". This step is optional for the simple app that we wrote here, but can be necessary for other Spring Boot applications if they need to actually write in the filesystem.

NOTE: To reduce http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp#Entropy_Source[Tomcat startup time] we added a system property pointing to "/dev/urandom" as a source of entropy. This is not necessary with more recent versions of Spring Boot, if you use the "standard" version of Tomcat (or any other web server).

To take advantage of the clean separation between dependencies and application resources in a Spring Boot fat jar file, we will use a slightly different implementation of the Dockerfile:

`Dockerfile`
[source]
----
include::complete/Dockerfile[]
----

This Dockerfile has a `DEPENDENCY` parameter pointing to a directory where we have unpacked the fat jar. From a Maven build:

```
$ mkdir -p target/dependency && (cd target/dependency; jar -xf ../*.jar)
```

or from a Gradle build:

```
$ mkdir -p build/dependency && (cd build/dependency; jar -xf ../libs/*.jar)
```


If we get that right, it already contains a `BOOT-INF/lib` directory with the dependency jars in it, and a `BOOT-INF/classes` directory with the application classes in it. Notice that we are using the application's own main class `hello.Application` (this is faster than using the indirection provided by the fat jar launcher).

NOTE: if you are using boot2docker you need to run it *first* before you do anything with the Docker command line or with the build tools (it runs a daemon process that handles the work for you in a virtual machine).

To build the image you can use the Docker command line. For example:

```
$ docker build -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker .
```

From a Gradle build, add the explicit build args:

```
$ docker build --build-args DEPENDENCY=build/dependency -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker .
```

TIP: Of course if you only used Gradle, you could just change the `Dockerfile` to make the default value of `DEPENDENCY` match the location of the unpacked archive.

Instead of building with the Docker command line, you might want to use a build plugin. Google has an open source tool called https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib] that has Maven and Gradle plugins. Probably the most interesting thing about it is that you don't need docker - it builds the image using the same standard output as you get from `docker build` but doesn't use `docker` unless you ask it to - so it works in environments where docker is not installed (not uncommon in build servers). 

=== Build a Docker Image with Maven
To get started quickly, you can run Jib without even changing your `pom.xml`:

```
$ ./mvnw com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:dockerBuild -Dimage=springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
```

To push to a Docker registry you use the `build` goal, instead of `dockerBuild`, i.e.

```
$ ./mvnw com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:build -Dimage=springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
```

To do that you will need to have permission to push to Dockerhub, which you won't have by default. Change the image prefix to your own Dockerhub ID, and `docker login` to make sure you are authenticated before you run Maven.

=== Build a Docker Image with Gradle
If you are using Gradle you need to add a new plugin like this:

`build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
  ...
  id 'com.google.cloud.tools.jib' version '1.8.0'
}
----

or in the older style used in the Getting Started Guides:

`build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
      maven {
        url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
      }
      mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:2.2.1.RELEASE')
include::complete/build.gradle[tag=build]
    }
}
include::complete/build.gradle[tag=plugin]
----

You can build a tagged docker image with Gradle in one command:

```
$ ./gradlew jibDockerBuild --image=springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
```

As with the Maven build, there is also a build task to build and push to the Docker registry:

```
$ ./gradlew jib --image=springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
```

If you have authenticated with `docker` on the command line, the image push will authenticate from your local `~/.docker` configuration.

=== After the Push

A "docker push" (or build plugin with "jib") in the example will fail for you (unless you are part of the "springio" organization at Dockerhub), but if you change the configuration to match your own docker ID then it should succeed, and you will have a new tagged, deployed image.

You do NOT have to register with docker or publish anything to run a docker image that was built locally. If you built with Docker (from the command line or from Jib), you still have a locally tagged image, and you can run it like this:

----
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
....
2015-03-31 13:25:48.035  INFO 1 --- [           main] s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
2015-03-31 13:25:48.037  INFO 1 --- [           main] hello.Application                        : Started Application in 5.613 seconds (JVM running for 7.293)
----

The application is then available on http://localhost:8080 (visit that and it says "Hello Docker World").

[NOTE]
====
When using a Mac with boot2docker, you typically see things like this at startup:

[source]
----
Docker client to the Docker daemon, please set:
    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/gturnquist/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376
----

To see the app, you must visit the IP address in DOCKER_HOST instead of localhost. In this case,
http://192.168.59.103:8080, the public facing IP of the VM.
====

When it is running you can see in the list of containers, e.g:

----
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
81c723d22865        springio/gs-spring-boot-docker:latest   "java -Djava.secur..."   34 seconds ago      Up 33 seconds       0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   goofy_brown
----

and to shut it down again you can `docker stop` with the container ID from the listing above (yours will be different):

----
$ docker stop goofy_brown
81c723d22865
----

If you like you can also delete the container (it is persisted in your filesystem under `/var/lib/docker` somewhere) when you are finished with it:

----
$ docker rm goofy_brown
----

=== Using Spring Profiles
Running your freshly minted Docker image with Spring profiles is as easy as passing an environment variable to the Docker run command

----
$ docker run -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod" -p 8080:8080 -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
----

or

----
$ docker run -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev" -p 8080:8080 -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
----

=== Debugging the application in a Docker container
To debug the application  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/conninv.html#Invocation[JPDA Transport] can be used. So we'll treat the container like a remote server.
To enable this feature pass a java agent settings in JAVA_OPTS variable and map agent's port
 to localhost during a container run. With the https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac[Docker for Mac] there is limitation due to that we can't
 access container by IP without https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/171[black magic usage].

----
$ docker run -e "JAVA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=n" -p 8080:8080 -p 5005:5005 -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
----

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just created a Docker container for a Spring Boot app! Spring Boot apps run on port 8080 inside the container by default and we mapped that to the same port on the host using "-p" on the command line.
